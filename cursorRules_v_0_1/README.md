# Cursor Agent Guidelines

## For Cursor Agents

This project uses a comprehensive `.cursor/` directory system to maintain consistent AI assistant behavior and project context. **All Cursor Agents working on this project MUST follow the rules and guidelines defined in the `.cursor/` directory.**

## .cursor Directory Overview

The `.cursor/` directory contains:

### 📁 **rules/** - AI Assistant Behavior Rules
- **6 specialized rule files** governing different aspects of AI behavior
- **Mandatory compliance** - these rules MUST be followed
- Covers command execution, timing, memory management, and safety protocols

### 📁 **memory/** - Session State Management  
- **`memory.md`** - Real-time session memory tracking
- **MUST be updated** after each significant action
- Maintains continuity across work sessions

### 📁 **docs/** - Project Documentation
- **Implementation plans** - Detailed implementation plans for specific tasks
- **Setup guides** - Environment setup and dependency resolution guides
- Contains comprehensive progress tracking and lessons learned

### 📁 **patches/** - Backup and Recovery
- Previous implementation attempts and rollback capabilities
- Complete patch files for recovery if needed

## Critical Rules for Cursor Agents

### 🚨 **MANDATORY RULES**
1. **Memory Tracking**: Always update `.cursor/memory/memory.md` after significant actions
2. **Implementation Tracking**: Update both memory.md and implementation files together
3. **Command Safety**: Never use unescaped `!` in shell commands
4. **Interactive Commands**: Use non-interactive flags (`--no-pager`, `| cat`, etc.)
5. **Long Commands**: Run extended operations in background (`is_background: true`)
6. **Filesystem Timing**: Check size before long filesystem operations

### 📋 **Project Status**
- Check `.cursor/memory/memory.md` for current project status
- Review `.cursor/docs/` for specific implementation plans
- Follow established patterns documented in the implementation files

## Quick Start for New Agents

1. **Read the rules**: Start with `.cursor/rules/README.md`
2. **Check memory**: Review `.cursor/memory/memory.md` for current status
3. **Review implementation**: Read relevant files in `.cursor/docs/` for detailed plans
4. **Follow patterns**: Use established implementation patterns from documentation
5. **Update memory**: Keep `.cursor/memory/memory.md` current throughout work
