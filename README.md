## Versions

### Version 0.2 (Latest)
- **Location**: `cursorRules_v_0_2/`
- **Focus**: Cross-cutting insights and reusable knowledge
- **Memory Management**: Updated to track cross-cutting insights rather than session-specific state
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive `.cursor/` directory system
  - 6 specialized rule files for AI behavior
  - Cross-cutting insights tracking
  - Implementation plans and setup guides
  - Backup and recovery capabilities

### Version 0.1
- **Location**: `cursorRules_v_0_1/`
- **Focus**: Session state management
- **Archive**: Contains the original implementation with session-based memory tracking

## Key Features

### 🚨 Mandatory Rules
1. **Memory Tracking**: Update `.cursor/memory/memory.md` with cross-cutting insights
2. **Implementation Tracking**: Maintain both memory and implementation files
3. **Command Safety**: Never use unescaped `!` in shell commands
4. **Interactive Commands**: Use non-interactive flags (`--no-pager`, `| cat`, etc.)
5. **Long Commands**: Run extended operations in background
6. **Filesystem Timing**: Check size before long filesystem operations

### 📁 Directory Structure
- **`rules/`** - AI Assistant Behavior Rules (6 specialized files)
- **`memory/`** - Cross-cutting insights and reusable knowledge
- **`docs/`** - Implementation plans and setup guides
- **`patches/`** - Backup and recovery files

## Usage

1. **For New Projects**: Copy the `.cursor/` directory structure from `cursorRules_v_0_2/`
2. **For Existing Projects**: Review and adapt the rules to your project's needs
3. **For AI Agents**: Follow the guidelines in the README files within each version

## Getting Started

### For New Projects
1. Review the README in `cursorRules_v_0_2/` for the latest guidelines
2. Understand the `.cursor/` directory structure
3. Adapt the rules to your specific project requirements
4. Implement the memory tracking and documentation systems

### For Existing Projects (Migration from v0.1)
If you have a Cursor Agent already running on v0.1 and don't want to start over:

1. **Use the Migration Guide**: See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions
2. **Run the Migration Script**: Use `./migrate_to_v0_2.sh` to copy files automatically
3. **Tell Your Agent**: Send the migration message to your existing agent to reload with new rules

**Key Migration Benefits**:
- ✅ Preserve all your current context and progress
- ✅ Keep hard-earned insights and architectural patterns
- ✅ Upgrade to more maintainable knowledge system
- ✅ Continue working without interruption
