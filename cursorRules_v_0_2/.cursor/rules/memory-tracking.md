# Memory Tracking Rule

## Rule: Update Memory.md with Cross-Cutting Insights

**MANDATORY**: Update `.cursor/memory/memory.md` with insights that would be useful across multiple implementations and sessions.

### What Goes in Memory.md:

- **Architecture patterns** discovered
- **Environment gotchas** and solutions
- **Key lessons learned** from implementations
- **Critical commands** and procedures
- **Authentication information**
- **Cross-cutting decisions** made
- **Reusable knowledge** that applies to future work

### What Does NOT Go in Memory.md:

- **Task-specific progress** (goes in IMPLEMENTATION_[Task].md)
- **Detailed implementation steps** (goes in IMPLEMENTATION_[Task].md)
- **Session-specific debugging** (goes in IMPLEMENTATION_[Task].md)
- **File modification lists** (goes in IMPLEMENTATION_[Task].md)
- **Current task status** (goes in IMPLEMENTATION_[Task].md)

### When to Update Memory.md:

1. **When discovering new architecture patterns** that apply to multiple implementations
2. **When encountering environment issues** that others might face
3. **When learning lessons** that would help future implementations
4. **When finding critical commands** or procedures
5. **When making cross-cutting decisions** about approach or methodology
6. **When updating authentication** or environment information

### Format:

Use clear, concise bullet points organized by category. Focus on reusable insights, not session-specific details.

### Enforcement:

This rule ensures memory.md contains valuable, reusable knowledge while keeping token usage low. Update it when you discover insights that would benefit future work.

**This rule maintains valuable cross-cutting knowledge while optimizing token usage.**
