## 🚀 Migration Guide: From Cursor to Continue.dev

### Step 1: Install Continue.dev
```bash
# Install Continue extension in VS Code
code --install-extension continue.continue
```

### Step 2: Configure Your Custom Model
```json
// ~/.continue/config.json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Memory Insights Assistant",
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "memory-insights",
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:8000/v1",
      "apiKey": "dummy-key",
      "contextLength": 4096
    }
  ],
  "customCommands": [
    {
      "name": "implement-field",
      "prompt": "Using our established patterns, implement a new field following the Estate Email Pattern: Add field directly to Estate model with @unique constraint, available for both creation and updates.",
      "description": "Implement new field using our patterns"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up Local Model Server
